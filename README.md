Just a visualization of courses and professors in Drexel University. Not meant to be used for anything, this is just a toy project made for fun. Lots of things aren't polished but that's okay. Only data for CCI 2024-25 Winter quarter is used. Visualization all colleges is too heavy on the browser.

Data was obtained from https://github.com/Zohair-coder/drexel-scraper.
